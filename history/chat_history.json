    "content": "I'm so sorry to hear that, Carolina. Nasal surgery can be a bit tricky, and dizziness is a common side effect, especially in the first 24 hours after surgery. It's essential to take it easy and rest as much as possible.\n\nTo help alleviate your dizziness, I recommend the following:\n\n1. **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration, which can exacerbate dizziness.\n2. **Elevate your head**: When you lie down, prop up your head with pillows to reduce congestion and alleviate dizziness.\n3. **Avoid sudden movements**: Move slowly and carefully to avoid making your body feel lightheaded.\n4. **Breathe deeply**: Take slow, deep breaths to help calm your body and reduce dizziness.\n5. **Follow your doctor's instructions**: Your doctor may have specific instructions for managing dizziness after nasal surgery. Be sure to follow their advice.\n\nIt's also essential to note that if your dizziness is severe, or if you experience any of the following, you should contact your doctor immediately:\n\n* Severe headache\n* Nausea or vomiting\n* Chest pain or difficulty breathing\n* Confusion or disorientation\n\nHow are you feeling now? Is there anything else I can do to help you feel more comfortable?"
